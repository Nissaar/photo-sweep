# Generates the release signing key for Photo Sweep.
#
# Run this ONCE. The resulting keystore is the app's permanent identity: Android
# only accepts an update if it is signed by the same key as the installed version.
# If you lose it, you can never update the app for anyone who installed it — they
# would have to uninstall first, losing their local data.
#
# Passwords are typed into keytool's own prompts, so they never appear in your
# shell history, in this script, or in any file.
#
# Usage:  ./tools/make-keystore.sh [output.jks] [alias]

You will be asked for:
  * a keystore password (choose a long, unique one — a password manager entry)
  * your name / organisation / location (these end up in the certificate;
    anything truthful is fine, and they cannot be changed later)

Note: PKCS12 keystores use one password for both the store and the key, so the
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD and KEY_PASSWORD secrets below get the same value.

Next steps
----------

1. BACK IT UP before doing anything else. See "Signing" in the README.
   At minimum: your password manager, plus one offline copy.

2. Add these four repository secrets on GitHub
   (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret):

     KEYSTORE_BASE64     base64 -w0 "$OUT"   (run it and paste the output)
     KEY_ALIAS           $ALIAS
     KEYSTORE_PASSWORD   the password you just chose
     KEY_PASSWORD        the same password

3. Keep the .jks OUT of git. The repo's .gitignore already excludes *.jks
   and *.keystore, but check before committing:  git status
